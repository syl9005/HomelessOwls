## Location
Fieldwork has been and will continue to be conducted annually to update the owl survey data near the Kielder reservoir (hereafter referred to as the Kielder Centre). Between 1975 and 1979, 40 tawny owl territories were identified, and in subsequent years, nest boxes specially designed for the tawny owl were erected at the centre of these territories. Additional boxes are placed within territories so that each breeding pair can have access to at least two boxes (Petty, 1992). Over 45 years of continuous breeding surveys, a total of 128 nest boxes were monitored in the most recent year (Figure 4). The boxes have remained in their original broad location unless external disturbance, such as storm damage or inaccessibility, necessitated their relocation.

Each survey season included three visits to all nest boxes, referred to hereafter as “checks” (Figure 5). The first check took place from late March to early April, when most owls exhibited signs of breeding or had begun laying eggs. If breeding activity, indicated by scrapes inside the box, was confirmed, a PIT logger was placed at the box entrance to identify breeding pairs. The size of any eggs present was measured at this point. The second check was scheduled based on expected hatching dates, which were calculated from egg volume. Breeding females and males were captured about eight days after hatching, and chicks were ringed eight days after the adults were caught. If adults were not captured during this period, the PIT logger was redeployed to identify the breeding pair. Previously empty boxes were also revisited at this time to look for signs of late breeding attempts. The final check was made 28 days after the second visit, focusing only on the empty boxes.
