## Location
Fieldwork has been and will continue to be conducted annually to update the owl survey data near the Kielder reservoir (hereafter referred to as the Kielder Centre). Between 1975 and 1979, 40 tawny owl territories were identified, and in subsequent years, nest boxes specially designed for the tawny owl were erected at the centre of these territories. Additional boxes are placed within territories so that each breeding pair can have access to at least two boxes (Petty, 1992). Over 45 years of continuous breeding surveys, a total of 128 nest boxes were monitored in the most recent year (Figure 4). The boxes have remained in their original broad location unless external disturbance, such as storm damage or inaccessibility, necessitated their relocation.
