## Location
Fieldwork has been and will continue to be conducted annually to update the owl survey data near the Kielder reservoir (hereafter referred to as the Kielder Centre). Between 1975 and 1979, 40 tawny owl territories were identified, and in subsequent years, nest boxes specially designed for the tawny owl were erected at the centre of these territories. Additional boxes are placed within territories so that each breeding pair can have access to at least two boxes (Petty, 1992). Over 45 years of continuous breeding surveys, a total of 128 nest boxes were monitored in the most recent year (Figure 4). The boxes have remained in their original broad location unless external disturbance, such as storm damage or inaccessibility, necessitated their relocation.

Each survey season included three visits to all nest boxes, referred to hereafter as “checks” (Figure 5). The first check took place from late March to early April, when most owls exhibited signs of breeding or had begun laying eggs. If breeding activity, indicated by scrapes inside the box, was confirmed, a PIT logger was placed at the box entrance to identify breeding pairs. The size of any eggs present was measured at this point. The second check was scheduled based on expected hatching dates, which were calculated from egg volume. Breeding females and males were captured about eight days after hatching, and chicks were ringed eight days after the adults were caught. If adults were not captured during this period, the PIT logger was redeployed to identify the breeding pair. Previously empty boxes were also revisited at this time to look for signs of late breeding attempts. The final check was made 28 days after the second visit, focusing only on the empty boxes.

_Figure 5. Timeline of the Tawny owl breeding survey. The dates of catching adults and ringing chicks may vary depending on breeding population density and vole abundance. Except for the occupied box, each box was checked approximately every 28 days._

Vole surveys were conducted twice a year to calculate the Vole Site Index (VSI), an approximate measure of vole population density at each site. Following the methodology described by Lambin et al. (2000), signs of vole presence, identified by fresh grass clippings, were recorded in 25 quadrats per site to calculate VSI values. The first survey was conducted in the spring, typically coinciding with the first owl check, as vole abundance during this period is closely linked to breeding success. The second survey took place in late September, a time considered critical for fledgling survival. Approximately 25 grassland sites were selected for monitoring, based on their proximity to the nest boxes.   
Dummy-eggs were placed in all empty owl boxes during the second check to investigate evidence of pine marten predation on tawny owls and to examine its spatial patterns. In Kielder Forest, several species, including squirrels, weasels, and pine martens, are capable of accessing nest boxes. However, pine martens are considered the primary suspect due to their ability to carry eggs in their mouths. Two types of eggs, chicken eggs and wax eggs, were used to mimic the typical clutch size of tawny owls, which ranges from two to four eggs. Camera traps were deployed to record predation events at occupied boxes. During the final check, any remaining pseudo-eggs were retrieved.
